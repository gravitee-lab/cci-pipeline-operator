# The Secret Hub Case

---

## What is Secret Hub ?

Have you ever heard about https://secrethub.io ? Let's play together

* On your everuday dev machine, Install `Secret Hub CLI` [following the official doc instructions](https://secrethub.io/docs/start/getting-started/#install)
* And then execute :
```bash
secrethub signup
```

---

# What just happened ?

* you created a SecretHub user account using the `Secret Hub` REST API
* the `Secret Hub` REST API came out of the std output is the **ROOT TOKEN** for your new Secret Hub account (user) :
  * using this ROOT Token gives full permissions : SO we never ever give anyone that TOKEN
  * we give tokens with only read permissions to pipeline service providers (Cirle Ci, Travis CI,  Gitlab CI)
* A new file was created on your filesystem, `~/.secrethub/credential`, and inside of it, you will find the  **ROOT TOKEN** for your new Secret Hub account persisted.
