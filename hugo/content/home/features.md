## Benchmark Results

- As of the Results of the Benchmark  :
  * I will explain how to read [the benchmark matrix](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cbmqrWuPd9IkOz3fweozo4EHKunsBTHaxgeA8fDhxrI/edit#gid=0), and the overall results
  * I will explain a case I did about `Circle CI` and one `Gravitee` Component (The APIM Gateway) : https://github.com/gravitee-lab/gravitee-gateway and one [successful execution](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/gravitee-lab/gravitee-gateway/37/workflows/b6c84de7-986c-4668-8f64-86936af20f47)
  * I will then propose to take questions about the pricing of each provider that passed the benchmark, at the very end of the presentation : because we have other things to discuss before.
